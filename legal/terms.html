        <h4>1.2 Understanding Usable Balance's Purpose</h4>
        <p>Usable Balance is a financial platform that helps you gain realtime, actionable insights from your financial information. Our services allow you to connect data sources (such as bank accounts or the IRD) so that we can generate real-time insights on your behalf (such as your Usable Balance - how much money in your account is safe to spend). To allow us to generate <a href="https://www.ird.govt.nz/gst/tax-invoices-for-gst" target="_blank">Taxable Supply Information</a> that can in time replace the need for receipts, you are approving us to use the information you provide in Taxable Supply Information for your customers, and for Usable Balance to supply you with Taxable Supply Information if you trade with a business that Usable Balance holds information on.</p>
